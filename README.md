# Cassiopei_v2.0-Disk_Wizard
The Disk Wizard application is specifically for use with the Cassiopei v2.0 (also referred to as the Cassiopei) and Commodore 8-bit computers. The application runs on the Commodore computer and is meant for making D64 images from or to disk.

The intention is to have a version for every 8-bit commodore computer that can work with the Cassiopei.
The first version of the application was written for the C64.

Everything is written in assembly using CBM program studio (which can be found here https://www.ajordison.co.uk/ )
