# Cassiopei_v2.0-Disk_Wizard
The Disk Wizard application is specifically for use with the Cassiopei v2.0 (also referred to as the Cassiopei) and Commodore 8-bit computers. The application runs on the Commodore computer and is meant for making D64 images from or to disk.

The intention is to have a version for every 8-bit commodore computer that can work with the Cassiopei.
The first version of the application was written for the C64.

Everything is written in assembly using CBM program studio (which can be found here https://www.ajordison.co.uk/ )

If you want to use this tool to convert your entire collection of CBM disks it is possible but... not to be preferred.
The D64 wizard is a program mainly intended for occasional use. Just to save you when you need to convert or restore that "one and only" critical disk.This is mainly because of it's speed, converting a disk takes many minutes per side. This is due to the fact that no speed routines are used to speed up the drive communication. Also formatting is still the standard formatting routine. The idea behind this is that these routines are simply the most reliable for use on old (sometimes poorly maintenanced) drives. You don't want the disk that is created working only on 1 drive (the drive you created it with), you want it to work on all drives.
Though technically this is still possible but requires lot's of research, mostly testing, withmany drives, many disks and many users...

If you do want to process your entire collection of disks, well then there are plenty of other solutions out there that do
focus on that and only that. For instance: http://www.6502.org/users/sjgray/software/cbmxfer/cbmxfer.html
